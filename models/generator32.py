# Generator
# ~~~~~~~~~
#
# The generator, :math:`G`, is designed to map the latent space vector
# (:math:`z`) to data-space. Since our data are images, converting
# :math:`z` to data-space means ultimately creating a RGB image with the
# same size as the training images (i.e.Â 3x64x64). In practice, this is
# accomplished through a series of strided two dimensional convolutional
# transpose layers, each paired with a 2d batch norm layer and a relu
# activation. The output of the generator is fed through a tanh function
# to return it to the input data range of :math:`[-1,1]`. It is worth
# noting the existence of the batch norm functions after the
# conv-transpose layers, as this is a critical contribution of the DCGAN
# paper. These layers help with the flow of gradients during training. An
# image of the generator from the DCGAN paper is shown below.

#
# Notice, the how the inputs we set in the input section (*nz*, *ngf*, and
# *nc*) influence the generator architecture in code. *nz* is the length
# of the z input vector, *ngf* relates to the size of the feature maps
# that are propagated through the generator, and *nc* is the number of
# channels in the output image (set to 3 for RGB images). Below is the
# code for the generator.
